Names: Evelyn Cupil-Garcia, Dane Erickson, Norah Tan


### Timeline

Start Date: When assignment was released

Finish Date: 10/11/2021

Hours Spent: ~100

### Primary Roles
- Norah Tan: backend Game Model functionality
- Evelyn Cupil-Garcia: ScreenDisplay functionality
- Dane Erickson: Displaying each creature on ScreenDisplay

### Resources Used


### Running the Program

Main class: Main

Data files needed: Cat, Dog, Turtle images. These are provided in the data folder.

Features implemented: Complete features for all games.



### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications: Clicking on a new creature image will change the image for all active creatures to that 
image on the next move i.e. if you have 3 turtles, click on cat, and give command “tell 1 2\nfd 100” turtles 1 and 2 
will change to cats and move forward 100 but turtle 3 will stay a turtle and not move.

To run Fractal, you must first initialize Fractal by filling out everything on the right side. Then you must type in the
commands and hit run.


Interesting data files: N/A

Known Bugs: When Darwin is run, there is a null pointer exception. If we had more time, we would have found the source
of this error and refactored so that this error would not occur anymore.

Extra credit: If you change the language in Main to "Spanish", the game will show all UI components in Spanish.


### Impressions
Learning how to resolve git merge conflicts, integrating code, using the debugger to its full capabilities, and overall
lots of communication
